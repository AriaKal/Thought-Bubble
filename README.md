# Thought-Bubble

**Version 1.0.0**

An iOS mobile application, which provides people of all ages and backgrounds with an online platform to voice their opinions about any philosophical topic. The aim of the project, ultimately speaking, is to enhance people’s critical thinking abilities while at the same time breaking the ice and opening up much-needed conversations about issues that intrigue all of humanity. Thought Bubble basically allows users to ***anonymously*** express themselves by casting a one-time vote (either agree or disagree) on philosophical claims. No user info is publicly disclosed to others.<br>

-- 

Long term updates for the app include advanced analysis from the statistical data obtained from the posts; the results of which would be represented to all users in sophisticated visualizations in a separate section. For now, this feature is limited to categorizing the claims based on how widely accepted or rejected they are by the general public i.e the users making up the platform. That is, claims which have a big number of voters agreeing with it will be listed in the *“Mostly Agreed”* subsection. Conversely, claims which have a big number of voters disagreeing with it will be listed in the *“Mostly Disagreed”* subsection. Finally, claims that have more or less an equal division between agreed number and disagreed number of votes will be listed in the *“Controversial”* subsection.
